I am a Ph.D. candidate in the [Information Systems Group](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/) at [the University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/), advised by [Prof. Dr. Dimka Karastoyanova](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/Main/DimkaKarastoyanova) and [Dr. Fatih Turkmen](https://www.cs.rug.nl/infosys/Main/FatihTurkmen)

In my research, I study various cryptographic methods to identify their strengths and weaknesses in terms of security and privacy when applied in decentralized settings. Additionally, I design protocols to improve these existing methods by combining cryptographic primitives with Blockchain and smart contracts. Specifically, I develop decentralized privacy-preserving methods for sharing and analysis of genomic data with the aim to support genomic data sharing and encourage collaborations. 

I earned a MSc. degree in Computer Science (Information Security and Privacy) from [RMIT University](https://www.rmit.edu.au/) in Melbourne Australia.
Prior to that, I got my BSc. degree in Computer Science from the [University of Auckland](https://www.auckland.ac.nz/) in Auckland, New Zealand. 

Next to research, I was a teaching assistance in advanced topics in security and privacy to MSc. (Computer Science) students. The teaching material and outcome can be found under teaching tab. In addition, I supervised 6 students, 3 master projetcs, and 3 bachelor projects. Information on the outcome of these projects can be found under the projects tab.

Outside of work, I enjoy drinking coffee, and riding my bike around Groningen.
